<h1>What I've learned so far about Github</h1>

<h2>Collaberator: Christopher Fulton</h2>

<p>I've learned that github is a rather good piece of software/cloud storage and repo site that can hold your data<br>
that will allow you to store and record changes easier. With the branching, it surely also makes it pretty neat and organized<br>
to consistently go from test, deving and then pushing out to production to let things run and **work**.

<strong>Branches, pull request, commits and remotes and pulling and pushing</strong> also makes it easier to collaberate with people in terms
of things that have been changed <i>too</i>. </p>

<p>I'm sure there's other things that I can learn about Github and git that I haven't touched upon.</p>
